- The CSS `calc()` function has been used to achieve responsiveness while maintaining correct margins.
- Fonts are locally embedded using `@font-face` and have been smoothed.
- Flexbox grid layout has been applied where necessary.
- A file structure has been created following the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology.
